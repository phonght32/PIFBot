## Setup
ROS distribution: Melodic
Ubuntu: Ubuntu 18.04

Clone the package in your catkin workspace and build to resolve missing dependencies.

## How to run
Before running the roslaunch command make sure that you have sensor_msgs/PointCloud2 sensor_msgs/Image topics up (and remmapped in test_lidar_camera.launch) as well as their respective tfs are published.
Filtered pointcloud and depth image messages will not be published until there are subscribers to their topics.    

Run the following command to launch the nodes:
```
roslaunch lidar_camera test_lidar_camera.launch
```
This will start the lidar_camera_node and rviz with respective config displaying the filtered colored pointclound and depth image.

Dynamic reconfigure can be used to apply cloud filtering and tinker with the depth image params.
